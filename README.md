# rjs-sampling-suite
A collection of (Lua) scripts for Reaper that automate tasks related to sample instrument creation.

The tasks include chopping, labelling and arranging samples for export. 

Rendered/exported files are named so that they are compatible with Kontakt's automapping feature.

Developed and tested in Reaper 6.12 on Win 10.
